### Overview
For our semester-end project, we developed a Google Gemini-powered file manager that simplifies file management. It swiftly organizes large folders, creates nested folders using natural language commands, and sends files directly via email. Additionally, it can generate custom outputs with Google Gemini, ready to attach to emails.
